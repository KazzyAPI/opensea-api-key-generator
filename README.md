This is a basic program made out of frustration. Have you ever thought man i need more api keys for opensea? Here is your answer

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install the modules.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Please note, i have added a small feature from google. Enter 1 email and based on the "amount-to-send", it will generate new emails so you wont need to worry about changing emails. All accepted will be sent to example@gmail.com.

```json
{

    
      "email": "example@gmail.com",
      "project": "Rarity checker",
      "project-description": "checks rarity of a given collection",
      "project-url": "RarityChecker,io",
      "amount-to-send": 10
    
  
}

```
